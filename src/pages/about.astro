          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Today's internet, despite its potential for connection and empowerment, is largely dominated by centralized platforms. These digital monopolies often prioritize profit over user well-being, leading to issues like data exploitation, censorship, algorithmic manipulation, and a stifling of innovation. The promise of a truly open, democratic, and user-controlled digital commons remains largely unfulfilled.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that the foundational infrastructure of our digital lives should not be in the hands of a few, but rather stewarded by the communities that depend on it.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Vision: The ICN Solution</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The InterCooperative Network (ICN) is a bold initiative to build a new layer of the internet â€“ a decentralized, cooperative digital infrastructure owned and governed by its users. We envision a network of interconnected, autonomous cooperatives that provide essential digital services (storage, communication, computation, etc.) based on principles of mutual aid, democratic governance, and shared prosperity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ICN aims to be a resilient, censorship-resistant, and equitable alternative to the centralized web, empowering individuals and communities to reclaim their digital sovereignty.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Guiding Principles</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Cooperative Ownership & Democratic Governance:</strong> Network infrastructure and services are owned and controlled by member cooperatives, operating on one-member-one-vote principles. No monarchs, no bosses.</li>
            <li><strong>Transparency & Openness:</strong> All core protocols, software, and governance processes are open source and publicly auditable.</li>
            <li><strong>Subsidiarity & Federation:</strong> Autonomous cooperatives manage their own affairs while federating for greater network strength and resilience.</li>
            <li><strong>Mutual Aid & Solidarity:</strong> Cooperatives support each other, fostering a resilient and collaborative ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Centricity & Data Sovereignty:</strong> Users control their data and digital identity. Services are designed for user benefit, not exploitation.</li>
            <li><strong>Ecological Sustainability:</strong> We strive to build and promote an internet that is environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooperative Prosperity:</strong> Value generated by the network is distributed equitably among its participants, not extracted by external shareholders.</li>
          </ul>
