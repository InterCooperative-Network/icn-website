          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Today's internet, despite its potential for connection and empowerment, is largely dominated by centralized platforms. These digital monopolies often prioritize profit over user well-being, leading to issues like data exploitation, censorship, algorithmic manipulation, and a stifling of innovation. The promise of a truly open, democratic, and user-controlled digital commons remains largely unfulfilled.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We believe that the foundational infrastructure of our digital lives should not be in the hands of a few, but rather stewarded by the communities that depend on it.

          <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Our Vision: The ICN Solution</h2>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The InterCooperative Network (ICN) is a bold initiative to build a new layer of the internet â€“ a decentralized, cooperative digital infrastructure owned and governed by its users. We envision a network of interconnected, autonomous cooperatives that provide essential digital services (storage, communication, computation, etc.) based on principles of mutual aid, democratic governance, and shared prosperity.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            ICN aims to be a resilient, censorship-resistant, and equitable alternative to the centralized web, empowering individuals and communities to reclaim their digital sovereignty.
