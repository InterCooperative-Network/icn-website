# ICN Observability and Monitoring

## Overview

The InterCooperative Network provides comprehensive observability capabilities to monitor network health, performance, and security across the federated infrastructure. This includes metrics collection, distributed tracing, event logging, and alerting systems.

## Core Observability Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Visibility

- Distributed tracing across network boundaries
- Real-time metrics collection and aggregation
- Historical data retention for trend analysis

### 2. Privacy-Preserving Monitoring
- Anonymized metrics collection where possible
- Opt-in detailed monitoring for sensitive operations
- Data sovereignty within federation boundaries
- Secure aggregation and reporting

### 3. Actionable Intelligence
- Proactive alerting on potential issues
- Root cause analysis capabilities
- Performance optimization recommendations
- Capacity planning insights

## Monitoring Architecture

### Metrics Collection

#### Node-Level Metrics
```rust
pub struct NodeMetrics {
    pub system: SystemMetrics,
    pub network: NetworkMetrics,
    pub mesh: MeshMetrics,

    pub dag: DagMetrics,
}
```

#### System Metrics

- Job queue depths and processing times
- Resource utilization during execution
- Error rates and failure modes

#### Economic Metrics

### Distributed Tracing

#### Request Flow Tracing
```rust
pub struct TraceContext {
    pub trace_id: TraceId,
    pub span_id: SpanId,
    pub parent_span_id: Option<SpanId>,
    pub baggage: HashMap<String, String>,
    pub sampling_decision: SamplingDecision,
}
```

#### Cross-Service Correlation
- End-to-end request tracking
- Service dependency mapping
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error propagation analysis

#### Mesh Job Tracing
- Job lifecycle from submission to completion
- Executor selection and assignment process
- Resource allocation and utilization
- Result validation and storage

### Event Logging

#### Structured Logging
```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
pub struct LogEvent {
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    pub level: LogLevel,
    pub source: String,
    pub message: String,
    pub fields: HashMap<String, Value>,
    pub trace_context: Option<TraceContext>,
}
```

#### Audit Trail
- All governance actions with cryptographic proofs
- Economic transactions and mana flows
- Identity and credential management events
- Security incidents and remediation actions

#### Security Events
- Authentication and authorization attempts
- Suspicious network activity detection
- Resource abuse and rate limiting triggers
- Cryptographic verification failures

## Monitoring Stack

    Critical,    // Immediate action required
    Warning,     // Attention needed
    Info,        // Informational only
}

pub struct Alert {
    pub id: AlertId,
    pub severity: AlertSeverity,

        "Total number of mesh jobs submitted"
    ).unwrap();
    
    pub static ref JOB_EXECUTION_DURATION: Histogram = Histogram::new(
        "icn_job_execution_duration_seconds",
