# ICN Governance System

## Overview

The InterCooperative Network governance system enables participatory decision-making through a formal proposal and voting mechanism. All network parameters, protocol upgrades, and policy changes are governed through transparent, verifiable processes that respect the federated nature of the network.

## Core Principles

### 1. Participatory Democracy
- All network participants can engage in governance processes
- Multiple levels of representation (individual, cooperative, federation)
- Transparent decision-making with verifiable outcomes

### 2. Federated Authority
- Different governance levels for different scopes of decisions
- Local autonomy within global coordination
- Subsidiarity principle: decisions made at appropriate levels

### 3. Explicit Policy
- All rules encoded as verifiable governance policies
- Version-controlled policy evolution
- CCL (Cooperative Contract Language) compilation to WASM

### 4. Economic Alignment
- Mana-based participation costs prevent spam
- Stake-based voting aligns incentives
- Economic consequences for governance outcomes

## Governance Levels

### Individual Level
- **Scope**: Personal settings, delegation preferences
- **Participants**: Individual DID holders
- **Threshold**: Simple majority (self)

### Cooperative Level  
- **Scope**: Cooperative internal policies, resource allocation
- **Participants**: Cooperative members
- **Threshold**: Configurable (typically 50-75%)

### Community Level
- **Scope**: Multi-cooperative coordination, shared infrastructure
- **Participants**: Cooperative representatives + individuals
- **Threshold**: Weighted voting based on stake/participation

### Federation Level
- **Scope**: Protocol changes, network-wide parameters
- **Participants**: Community representatives + major stakeholders
- **Threshold**: High threshold (67-80%) + technical review

## Proposal Types

### Parameter Proposals
Modify existing network parameters without code changes, such as mana regeneration rates, job cost multipliers, voting thresholds, and reputation parameters.

### Policy Proposals
Introduce or modify governance policies via CCL, including new economic models, membership criteria, dispute resolution procedures, and resource allocation algorithms.

### Protocol Proposals
Major protocol changes requiring code modifications, such as new consensus mechanisms, API changes, cryptographic upgrades, and federation topology changes.

### Constitutional Proposals
Fundamental changes to governance itself, including voting mechanism changes, quorum requirements, emergency procedures, and rights and responsibilities.

## Voting Mechanisms

### Voting Systems

#### Simple Majority
- **Use**: Basic parameter changes
- **Threshold**: 50% + 1 of votes cast
- **Quorum**: Minimum participation required

#### Supermajority
- **Use**: Significant protocol changes
- **Threshold**: 67% or 75% of votes cast
- **Quorum**: Higher minimum participation

#### Qualified Majority
- **Use**: Constitutional changes
- **Threshold**: 80%+ with additional requirements
- **Quorum**: Very high participation required

### Vote Delegation

#### Direct Delegation
Delegate all voting power to a trusted representative with configurable scope and expiration.

#### Topic-Based Delegation
Delegate voting power for specific governance areas with weighted percentages.

#### Liquid Democracy
Transitive delegation with override capabilities and loop prevention.

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Proposal Fast-Track
For critical security or stability issues:
- Emergency council pre-approval (5 of 7 members)
- 24-hour voting window (instead of 7 days)
- Lower quorum requirements (10% vs 15%)
- Automatic reversal if found to be misused

### Network Halt Procedures
For extreme situations threatening network integrity with different authority levels:
- **Local Halt**: Cooperative can halt internal operations
- **Regional Halt**: Federation can halt regional coordination
- **Global Halt**: Requires 90%+ supermajority with emergency procedures

## Monitoring and Transparency

### Governance Metrics
Track proposal statistics, participation rates, delegation patterns, and decision effectiveness.

### Audit Trail
All governance actions recorded in immutable DAG with timestamps, actors, proposals, votes, outcomes, and DAG anchors.

### Public Dashboards
Real-time governance transparency including:
- Active proposals and voting status
- Participation rates by demographic
- Decision implementation tracking
- Economic impact of governance decisions

## Best Practices

### For Proposers
- Provide comprehensive rationale and impact analysis
- Engage in pre-proposal community discussion
- Consider phased implementation for large changes
- Prepare for questions and feedback during discussion period

### For Voters
- Research proposals thoroughly before voting
- Consider long-term impacts beyond immediate benefits
- Participate in discussion to improve proposals
- Use delegation responsibly for areas outside expertise

### For Delegates
- Clearly communicate voting philosophy and positions
- Provide regular updates to delegators
- Maintain transparency about potential conflicts of interest
- Allow delegation revocation with appropriate notice

The ICN governance system creates a balance between democratic participation and effective decision-making, enabling the network to evolve while maintaining stability and fairness.
