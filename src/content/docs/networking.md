# ICN Networking Architecture

## Overview

The InterCooperative Network uses a sophisticated peer-to-peer networking architecture built on libp2p to enable decentralized communication, resource discovery, and coordination across the federated network.

## Core Networking Principles

### 1. Peer-to-Peer Foundation
- No central coordination points or single points of failure
- Direct peer-to-peer communication using libp2p protocols
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- Resilient routing and message delivery

### 2. Federated Topology
- Hierarchical organization from local cooperatives to global federation
- Local autonomy with global connectivity
- Efficient routing within and between federation levels
- Scalable architecture supporting millions of nodes

### 3. Content-Addressed Communication
- All data identified by cryptographic hashes (CIDs)
- Content routing via distributed hash table (DHT)
- Efficient content discovery and retrieval
- Built-in data integrity verification

## Network Architecture

### libp2p Integration

ICN leverages libp2p's modular networking stack:

#### Core Protocols
- **Kademlia DHT**: Peer and content discovery
- **Gossipsub**: Efficient message broadcasting
- **Noise**: Secure transport encryption
- **Yamux**: Stream multiplexing
- **QUIC**: Modern transport protocol

#### Network Services
```rust
pub struct NetworkService {
    swarm: Swarm<NetworkBehaviour>,
    peer_store: PeerStore,
    routing_table: RoutingTable,
    content_discovery: ContentDiscovery,
}
```

### Federation Topology

### Node Types and Roles

#### Full Nodes
- **Function**: Complete network participation
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Store and serve DAG content
  - Participate in mesh computing
  - Relay messages for light nodes
  - Maintain DHT routing tables
- **Requirements**: Stable network connection, adequate storage

#### Light Nodes
- **Function**: Resource-constrained participation
- **Capabilities**:
  - Submit mesh jobs and governance proposals
  - Query network for content and services
  - Limited local storage and computing
- **Requirements**: Basic network connectivity

#### Bootstrap Nodes
- **Function**: Network entry points
- **Capabilities**:
  - Help new nodes discover peers
  - Maintain stable network addresses
  - Provide initial DHT bootstrapping
- **Requirements**: High availability, stable addresses

#### Validator Nodes
- **Function**: Network integrity and consensus
- **Capabilities**:
  - Validate transactions and receipts
  - Participate in governance consensus
  - Dispute resolution and arbitration
- **Requirements**: Enhanced security, high uptime

## Network Protocols

### Peer Discovery

#### Bootstrap Discovery
New nodes connect to known bootstrap nodes to join the network.

#### DHT Discovery
Ongoing peer discovery via Kademlia DHT:
- Periodic peer queries
- Content-based peer discovery
- Capability-based peer filtering

#### mDNS Discovery
Local network discovery for development and private networks:
- Automatic discovery on local subnet
- Zero-configuration networking
- Development environment support

### Content Discovery and Routing

#### Content Addressing
All content identified by Content Identifiers (CIDs) for efficient content location via distributed hash table with proximity-based routing and redundant storage discovery.

#### Content Exchange
Efficient content transfer protocols including BitSwap-style block exchange, streaming for large content, and partial content requests.

### Message Broadcasting

#### Gossipsub Mesh
Efficient message propagation using gossipsub with topic-based message routing, epidemic-style message spreading, and message deduplication and validation.

## Security and Privacy

### Transport Security
- **Noise Protocol**: Secure channel establishment
- **TLS 1.3**: Alternative secure transport
- **Identity Verification**: DID-based peer authentication

### Message Security
- **Content Signing**: All messages cryptographically signed
- **Replay Protection**: Timestamp and nonce validation
- **Message Encryption**: Optional end-to-end encryption

### Privacy Protection
- **Onion Routing**: Optional traffic anonymization
- **IP Address Protection**: NAT traversal and relay support
- **Metadata Minimization**: Reduced identifying information

## Network Performance

### Optimization Strategies

#### Connection Pooling
- Persistent connections to frequently contacted peers
- Connection multiplexing for efficiency
- Adaptive connection limits based on resources

#### Caching and Prefetching
- Local content caching for performance
- Predictive content prefetching
- Distributed cache coordination

#### Bandwidth Management
- Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization
- Bandwidth limiting and throttling
- Adaptive bitrate for large content

### Monitoring and Metrics

Network health monitoring includes peer connectivity and churn rates, content discovery success rates, message delivery reliability, and network partition detection.

## Federation Coordination

### Inter-Federation Communication
- Standardized federation protocols
- Cross-federation message routing
- Federated governance coordination
- Shared resource discovery

### Load Balancing
- Geographic request routing
- Capability-based load distribution
- Automatic failover mechanisms
- Resource availability advertising

### Conflict Resolution
- Network partition handling
- Competing federation coordination
- Protocol version compatibility
- Graceful degradation strategies
