# Request for Comments (RFCs)

Requests for Comments (RFCs) are the primary mechanism for proposing, discussing, and ratifying new features, protocols, standards, and significant changes within the InterCooperative Network (ICN). They serve as the backbone of ICN's standardization, coordination, and federated governance processes.

This section houses all RFC documents, both proposed and accepted.

## RFC Structure (Proposed)

As the number of RFCs grows, we may adopt a numbering convention to help organize them by topic, for example:

*   **`0000-0009`**: Meta-RFCs, Process, Philosophy, and Foundational Principles
*   **`0010-0019`**: Core Systems (Runtime, Identity, Economy, etc.)
*   **`0020-0029`**: Networking, Protocols, and Interoperability
*   **`0030-0039`**: Component Manifests, APIs, and Developer Tooling
*   **`0040-0049`**: Observability, Metrics, and Auditing
*   *(Further ranges to be defined as needed)*

## Contents

Currently, this section contains:

- [`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md) â€” The official template to be used for all new RFC submissions. It outlines the required sections and provides guidance for authors.

*As RFCs are proposed and accepted, they will be listed here.* 

## Contributing to RFCs

**Proposing a New RFC:**

1.  Copy the [`0000-template.md`](./0000-template.md).
2.  Rename it (e.g., `XXXX-my-proposal-title.md` - `XXXX` will be assigned upon merge, or you can use `0000` for the PR).
3.  Fill out the template thoroughly.
4.  Submit your RFC via a Pull Request to this repository.

**Discussing RFCs:**

*   RFCs under review (via Pull Requests) can be discussed directly on the PR.
*   Broader discussions about potential RFCs or ICN governance can take place on the [InterCooperative Network GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/InterCooperative-Network/discussions).

Active participation in the RFC process is crucial for the health and evolution of ICN. Refer to the main [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for general contribution guidelines and `../onboarding/contribute-governance.md` for more on the governance process.
