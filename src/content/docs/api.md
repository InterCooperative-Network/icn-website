## Mesh Job Execution Pipeline

The canonical mesh job lifecycle involves multiple crates working together:

1. **Submission** (`icn-runtime`, `icn-mesh`)
   - Job submitted via Host ABI
   - Mana verification via `icn-economics`
   - Job added to pending queue

2. **Bidding** (`icn-mesh`, `icn-network`)  
   - Job announced to network
   - Executors submit bids
   - Reputation and resource verification

3. **Assignment** (`icn-runtime`, `icn-mesh`)
   - Executor selection algorithm
   - Job state transition to assigned
   - Executor notification

4. **Execution** (External executor)
   - Job execution by assigned node
   - Result production and signing

5. **Anchoring** (`icn-runtime`, `icn-dag`, `icn-identity`)
   - Receipt validation and storage
   - DAG anchoring of results
   - Reputation system updates

## Testing and Development

All crates include comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for cross-crate interactions  
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Property-based testing where applicable

## API Stability

- **Internal APIs**: Between core crates, may change with proper deprecation
- **External APIs**: Defined in `icn-api`, follow semantic versioning
- **Host ABI**: Runtime ABI functions maintain backward compatibility

## Error Handling

All crates follow a consistent error handling philosophy:
- Return `Result<T, CommonError>` for recoverable errors
- Specific error variants in `CommonError` enum
- Context preservation through error propagation
- No panics in library code

## Documentation

Each crate maintains:
- README.md with purpose and usage
- Comprehensive rustdoc for public APIs
- Code examples and integration guides
- Architecture decision records where relevant
